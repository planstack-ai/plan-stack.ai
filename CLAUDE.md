# Plan Stack Website

Official website for Plan Stack - plan-stack.ai

## Development Workflow

This repository follows Plan Stack methodology.

Before making changes:
1. Check docs/plans/ for similar past implementations
2. Create implementation plan in docs/plans/YYYYMMDD_feature_name.md
3. Get approval before coding
4. After implementation, verify against the plan

## Structure

- `index.html` - Landing page
- `articles/` - Blog posts
- `learn/` - Claude Code tutorials
  - `basics/` - 5 lessons + quiz

## Learn Content Philosophy

Articles under `learn/` follow context-window thinking applied to writing:

- Each article: 1–2 minutes reading time
- Density over volume
- No padding for authority

We respect reader attention the same way we respect token limits.
